Fork of [sindresorhus/pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) with minor tweaks for my personal use, like:

 - Single line prompt
 - Fishlike path (e.g. `~/path/to/somewhere` -> `~/p/t/somewhere`)
 - Display number of patches next to up and down arrows in git repository
 - Wrap Git info in parentheses
 - A few color tweak
